# MCP Server enabling access to the Foursquare API

## Getting Started

### Foursquare API Key

You will need a Foursquare API Key to allow your AI agent to access Foursquare API endpoints. If you do not already have one, follow the instructions on [Foursquare Doc - Get Started](https://docs.foursquare.com/developer/reference/places-api-get-started) to create one. You will need to log in to your Foursquare developer account or create one if you do not have one (creating a basic account is free and includes some starter credit for your project). Be sure to copy the API key upon creation as you will not be able to see it again.

### Set up MCP Server

* *Python*: follow the directions in [fsq-server-python/README.md](fsq-server-python/README.md) for instructions on setting up a python based MCP server using uv.
